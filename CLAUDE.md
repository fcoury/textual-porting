- Check AGENTS.md for general instructions
- NEVER try to simplify complex tasks, unless explicitly instructed
- NEVER make design changes. If you find errors or anything else that needs change during the implementation, refer back to the design documents at @conductor/tracks/core_app_lifecycle_20251221/design and propose the changes there.
